### And now you have to change hardware ids:

1 - Open the link to Command Prompt and type this command:

Code:
```
cd [path to "HWID spoof" folder]
```

2 - Then type to change UUID (replace X with a random character uppercase or lowercase or with a number)

```
Code:
1.AMIDEWINx64.EXE /SU AUTO 
2.AMIDEWINx64.EXE /BS XXXXXXXX

### Then modify some registers:

4 - Generate a new GUID

5 - Copy and paste the new GUID into the "MachineGuid" key.

6 - Do the same thing with this path: "Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\IDConfigDB\Hardware Profiles\0001"


### And create a new Windows user, give him administrator rights and change pc name (note that if you reinstalled windows you don't need to do this):

1 - Open CMD as administrator and type

```
Code:
1.Net user [username] [password] /add
2.net localgroup administrators [username] /add
```
3 - Open pc settings

2 - Click on system

3 - Click on info

4 - Change pc name

5 - Reboot your pc

### Only if your UUID and/or Baseboard Serial number don't stick after reboot (usually with ASUS mobos):

1 - Format a USB device in FAT32

2 - Put everything inside the "Efi shell" folder inside the USB device

3 - Open id.nsh with notepad and modify what needed

4 - Turn off you pc and open the BIOS (usually with F2 or end at the starting of the pc)

5 - Put the USB device as first to run and your drive where Windows is installed as second

6 - You have to leave plugged in the USB device every time you start the pc
